Moose,Counselor,moose.jpg,,"Camp Kesem nurtures and uplifts in a capacity I hadn’t yet experienced elsewhere. After spending only one week at camp, I’m confident that we built a community that I can depend on for laughs, support, and love. I’ll always cherish both the deep connections and wonderful memories I made — especially this upcoming year as I await the next week of Camp Kesem with the Claremont Colleges team!"
