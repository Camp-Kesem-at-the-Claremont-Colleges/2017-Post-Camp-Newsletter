4,Thursday,Messy Wars,"One of the best parts about camp is a day of messy eventsâ€”Messy Wars! The campers and counselors alike love Messy Wars, even though nobody likes cleaning up.

Some of the campers ended up getting much more messy than our counselors and staff but we all hosed them down before continuing with the rest of our day.",color_wars2.jpg
