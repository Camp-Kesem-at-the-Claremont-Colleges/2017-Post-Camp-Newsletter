<p>Driving along the windy mountains roads while the sun is its peak evokes a certain picturesque imagery. You and your friends casting your cares to the wind, sailing down the highway while the summer&rsquo;s top 40 playlist is going. Definitely a very innocent, happy montage moment in your cheesy 80s movie.</p>

<p>Not for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a worrier. I like stability and predictability, and I am guilty of over-analyzing everything. So my golden hour mountain drive went a little something like, &ldquo;Oh no, you&rsquo;re going too fast. Calm down, this isn&rsquo;t Fast and the Furious. Why is everyone talking so loud?? I am trying to drive! You&rsquo;re in charge of a bunch of campers that are how old?? Play it cool, play it cool, you&rsquo;re fine. What do you mean sink hole???&rdquo;</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was pretty terrified of camp. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t a key player in the planning process, I&rsquo;d never been to camp as a child, and heck if I knew how to be a counselor. As far as I was concerned, the campers were going to be too cool for me and I was going to be too awkward and my cabin was going to find out how much of a weirdo I really am. We weren&rsquo;t going to be friends and I was going to be very, very sad.</p>

<p>Determined to not let my fears get the better of me, I summoned the small part of me that is extroverted and outgoing, and told myself that camp was going to be a good experience. I was going to make friends with as many people as I could, and be active and involved with all of the activities planned for the week. I was prepared for everything, except for the immediate emotional rollercoaster that came as a result.</p>

<p>Little did I know, all of the campers and counselors I met that wonderful week would leave a lifelong impression on me. I was moved by the kindness and innocence I saw in these individuals who had to be strong as such a young age. My teenage campers were 100% too cool for me, but they never let it show because they were always respectful and sincere. The younger children struck me with a maturity that many people older than myself still struggle to learn. I had unknowingly surrounded myself with a community of people who were strong and, together, made each other stronger.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair for me to say that I left Camp Kesem different than how I walked in. How could I possibly be the same person after Empowerment and after Closing Circle? These were defining moments in which our collective vulnerability reminded me to be a more supportive and kind person.</p>

<p>There is a saying that kept repeating in my mind throughout camp that goes, &ldquo;Be kind to others, for everyone is fighting their own battle.&rdquo; I was reminded of this each time a camper or counselor willingly bared their soul to a group of people they had known for no longer than 5 days. Each time I felt a gentle, anonymous tap on my shoulder during Closing Circle, telling me I had left as much of an impression on someone as they certainly did on me. Each time I watched a camper leave and my heart squeezed, praying this would not be the last time we meet.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I am a little upset with myself. As a rising senior, I only have one more year with Kesem and that thought is a little upsetting. Though the chapter at Claremont is only two years old, I felt as if I were showing up to a family reunion that I never wanted to end. Very few times in my life have I been a part of a group or organization that made me feel empowered and inspired to continue participating, and I can confidently say that all credit is due to the people who participated and made camp so meaningful. So, here&rsquo;s to hoping that many, if not all of you beloved campers, will come back to Claremont Camp Kesem in 2018 so that we may be able to resume our friendship right where it left off.</p>
