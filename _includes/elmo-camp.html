<p>I don't even know where to start with this. When Cookie Monster asked me to say a little something about my experience at Claremont I put it off for the longest time because there is just too much love that I have for this chapter that can't be accurately translated into words.</p>
<p>These kiddos and their families have inspired me to become better and better each and every day. There isn't a single day that I don't talk about how incredible each member of this chapter is. There isn't a single day that I don't think about these families and feel love, joy, inspiration, and sadness. Sadness because I don't know if I will get the chance to come back and be with everyone again. Everyday I am incredibly thankful to have been a part of this wonderful organization.</p>
<p>These campers and camper families have changed me and taught me so much. They have taught me what happiness, strength, kindness, vulnerability, and selflessness looks like. There is nothing out there like this camp. Every interaction I have had and relationship I have built will be with me throughout my life. A constant reminder of who I want to be and the kind of thing I want to provide for the people around me and the organizations I am a part of.</p>
<p>I will always be here for each and everyone of you. If there ever comes a time where you all need someone to lean on 1,5,10,or 20+ years from now I will be here. I will always be here. And I can only hope that I was able to provide half as much to you all as you have provided for me. I hope I gave you all some good memories to take with you throughout your lives. Thank you Campers, Guardians, and Counselors for being a part of my journey and shaping me into the person I am today.</p>
