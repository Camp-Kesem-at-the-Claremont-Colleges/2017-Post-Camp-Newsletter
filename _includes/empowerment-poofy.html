<p>It had come. Three days into camp, and it was time for the Empowerment ceremony. Since it was my first time as a counselor, I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. How would the other kids react, what was expected of the counselors, who would be brave enough to share their stories----these were all the questions that were flooding my mind as we entered the empowerment yurt. Candles were lit all across the yurt; a hush befell the crowd and there was a palatable change to the ambience surrounding the yurt. Almost immediately, I knew that I was in a safe space.</p>

<p>Empowerment began with cross-the-line, an event which involved answering a series of questions by crossing a blue tape. After the event, my nervousness and anxiety waned, as I no longer felt isolated or alone, but rather a part of the collective. Participating in Cross-the-line made me aware that I was in a room full of people who shared similar experiences as I. I could feel the empathy and love in the room as the foundations for a community were being set.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the floor opened up to those willing and brave enough to share their stories. Immediately, one of the campers volunteered, took center stage, and shared his story. Sharing such a private experience left him vulnerable, but seeing his courage empowered me to share my story, so I got up, just as he had, took a deep breath, and started to tell my story of how cancer impacted my life. Overall, Empowerment Ceremony shook me to my core. I felt as a burden had been lifted from my shoulders, as I was finally surrounded by people who could relate and empathize with me. The ceremony acted as an important reminder as to why Camp Kesem exists; Kesem brings all these stories together and uses them to build community and empower youth.</p>
