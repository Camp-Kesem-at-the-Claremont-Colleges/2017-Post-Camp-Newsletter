<p>One word comes to mind when describing Camp Kesem and that's love. I came to Camp Kesem because I wanted to connect with children on a more personal level, as a nurse my job is to nurture their wounds and take care of any physical harm but what's more important to me as a nurse is healing their mind, heart, and soul. Camp Kesem is a safe haven for children that are going through a very difficult time and are able to tear down their walls and let go of their anger or frustration and just be themselves. Having had cancer affect my family I know that it can take pieces of the person you are and slowly start to break down your spirit, I saw those broken spirits in all those beautiful children's eyes, but with everyday at Camp Kesem slowly but surely not only did I see sparkle once again, I saw hope. Camp Kesem has some of the most amazing, compassionate, honest people I have ever known and I am so thankful they made me apart of everyone of these children's journey for life.</p>
