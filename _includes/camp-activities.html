<p>This year, we had four different kinds of activities: Sports, Arts and Crafts, Cooking and Science, and Acting. Since our week's theme was spy camp, a lot of our activities were spy-themed. For example, we crafted face masks to match our spy and superhero personalities, and we did a fingerprint dusting activity! We also had a spy programming section, where kids could make an avatar on Scratch (a programming language for kids) and create their own spy stories and animations.</p>

<p>Some of our other activities included Super Chef, where campers create food dishes out of pre-determined ingredients for the counselors to eat (some campers sneaked cardboard into their lovely dishes!). Messy Wars was also wildly popular, since campers and counselors could run around covering each other in paint and holi-powder. At the end of Messy Wars, we had an activity called Human Sundae, where all of the campers and counselors covered the Admin team in whipped cream, chocolate syrup, strawberry jam, sprinkles, and maraschino cherries. Overall, everyone enjoyed each of the activities (shoutout to Pogo, our Operations Coordinator who planned the entire schedule!).</p>

<p>Despite some issues with the weather, we still had a lot of fun with our outdoor activities. My favorite activity was part of the water wars - we separated the campers into three groups and assigned a counselor to each group. The campers were given sponges and asked to squeeze the sponges filled with water on top of the counselors' heads. I remember getting absolutely soaked but having so much fun rooting for my team. My team also dumped the bucket over my head after the activity. It took a while for me to dry off but it was definitely worth it! I also have a love-hate relationship with the activity, Human Sundae. It was my first time ever doing this activity, and while it was fun getting completely covered in whipped cream and chocolate syrup, showering afterwards was really hard. I'm still finding random sprinkles in my hair sometimes, and the smell of chocolate still lingers. But would I do this activity again? I think so, because we all had so much fun turning me into a dessert. Maybe next time we'll have some other counselors join me.</p>
